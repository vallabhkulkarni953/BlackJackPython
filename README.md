## BlackJack Card Game:
<p>Blackjack is a popular casino card game that combines strategy and luck. The goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible, without exceeding it, while also beating the dealer's hand.

<b>Basic Rules</b><br>
<b>Players and Dealer:</b>

- Blackjack is typically played between a dealer and one or more players.
- Each player competes against the dealer, not against other players.

<b>Card Values:</b>

- Number cards (2–10) are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.
- Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, whichever benefits the hand most.

<b>The Deal:</b>

- Each player and the dealer receive two cards.
- Players' cards are dealt face-up.
- The dealer has one card face-up and one face-down (the "hole card").

<b>Gameplay:</b>

- Players decide how to play their hand, aiming for a total value as close to 21 as possible.
- If a player's total exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose the round.

<b>Player Options:</b>
- Hit: Take another card to increase the hand value.
- Stand: Keep the current hand and end the turn.
- Double Down: Double the initial bet, take exactly one more card, and stand afterward.
- Split: If the first two cards are of equal value (e.g., two 8s), they can be split into two separate hands. Each hand gets an additional card, and the player places a second bet equal to the first.
- Surrender: Forfeit half the bet and end the round (available in some versions).

<b>Dealer Rules:</b>
The dealer must follow specific rules:

- Hit if their hand value is 16 or less.
- Stand if their hand value is 17 or more (in most versions).
- The dealer does not make strategic choices; their moves are automatic based on the rules.

<b>Winning Conditions:</b>
A player wins if:

- Their hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's.
- The dealer busts (exceeds 21) while the player does not.

<b>Betting:</b>
Before the cards are dealt, each player places a bet.
Players win or lose based on their hand versus the dealer’s.
